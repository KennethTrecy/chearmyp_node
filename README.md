# Chearmyp Node
A concrete implementation of nodes for Chearmyp language.

## Origin
It was in a repository with the parser library. Yet it has been forked as some possible use cases
may not need as parser.

The repository uses the template based from [`filled_bare_metal`] branch of [Feo Template].

## Nodes
The nodes here have been implemented as enumerations. The attacher collections and node queues are
`VecDeque`s.
